# ⏱ CounterLike System (OOP in Python)

This project implements an **Object-Oriented Counter System** in Python with examples of:
- Abstract classes and inheritance
- Polymorphism (`advance()` method)
- Composition (`LikeList` → `User`)
- Simple GUI-like hierarchy (`Button` → `Polygon`)

---

## 📘 Overview

The program simulates a flexible counter mechanism where different types of counters (up/down) share a common interface but behave differently.  
It also includes a small example of a social "Like List" and a clickable Button class to demonstrate **composition** and **inheritance**.
